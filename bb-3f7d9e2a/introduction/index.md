# Introduction

Welcome to Signet’s Block Builder Docs. This documentation will help you understand how to build blocks, capture value, and participate in our unique ecosystem. For more general information about Signet, see our

[public docs](../../)

.

## Key Features for Builders

As a Signet Block Builder, you construct blocks by selecting transactions and bundles, then submit those blocks to Ethereum.

* **Direct Sequencer Access**: Work directly with the Signet sequencer in a round-robin slot system, unlike traditional PBS auctions.
* **Capture MEV and Sequencer Fees**: Directly extract value from transactions within your blocks.
* **Fair Block Production**: Round-robin sequencing ensures equitable opportunities for all builders.

## Quickstart

To get started as a block builder:

1. **[Clone and build](../run-a-builder/clone-and-build/)** the Signet builder repository
2. **[Set up authentication](../run-a-builder/authentication/)** to connect to the sequencer
3. **[Install and run a node](../run-a-builder/install-and-run-a-node/)** to start building blocks
