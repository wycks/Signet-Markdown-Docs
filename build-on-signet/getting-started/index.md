# Getting Started with Signet

Signet is a reimagining of the EVM rollup stack, built on Ethereum. Signet
offers features that other rollups can’t, including:

* Instant bridging of assets from Ethereum
* Native support for Ethereum transactions
* Full EVM compatibility
* Instant cross-chain transactions with Ethereum

Signet is designed to be easy to use, easy to integrate with, and easy to build
on. System actions are exposed as smart contracts, so developers can build on
Signet using familiar tools and languages.
